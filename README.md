## Pokedex of all the 150 classic Pokemons using Javascript Vanilla

- I did only the Javascript logic for this project, the stylesheet was downloaded in [this repository](https://github.com/Roger-Melo/pokedex) (although I modified it a bit)
- For the Pokemons infos I used [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
- And for images [this link](https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/001.png) (only modifying the pokemon ID on the URL)
<br/>

## What I've learned in this project:
- Applied code refactoring for the first time;
- How to interact with the HTML using just vanilla Javascript.

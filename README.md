# Pokedex of all the 150 classic Pokemons using Javascript Vanilla

### [Pokedex link](https://abraao-s.github.io/pokedex-js-vanilla/)
<br/>

- I did only the Javascript logic for this project, the stylesheet was downloaded in [this repository](https://github.com/Roger-Melo/pokedex) (although I modified it a bit)
- For the Pokemons infos I used [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
- And for images [this link](https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/001.png) (only modifying the pokemon ID on the URL)

### This project was useful to me as I applied refactoring for the first time and learned how to interact with the HTML using just Vanilla Javascript
